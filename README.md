# SACHIN-VS-VIRAT-Cricket Stats Comparison
This project is a comprehensive analysis comparing the cricket statistics of two legendary cricketers: Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, along with their contemporaries. By examining key performance parameters such as runs per innings, strike rate, centuries (100s), half-centuries (50s), and team contribution, this notebook aims to provide a data-driven perspective on who stands out as the better player relative to their peers.

# Project Overview
The notebook leverages historical data to perform a detailed comparison of Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohliâ€™s careers by comparing their performance metrics against other players from their respective eras. The following parameters are analyzed:
Runs per Innings: Average runs scored per innings by each player compared to their peers.

Strike Rate: Measure of how quickly the player scores runs compared to others in their era.

Centuries (100s): Number of times the player scored 100 runs or more in an innings compared to others in their era.

Half-Centuries (50s): Number of times the player scored 50 runs or more in an innings compared to others in their era.

Team Contribution: Contribution of the player's runs to the team's total score compared to their peers.
